## Dsgn-270-a3 - SVG Logo Design
- A headphone company was the subject of the design idea. The svg logo was inspired by a company that creates headphones that allow users to fully immerse themselves in their music, disconnect from the outer world, and enjoy themselves. The logo is a pair of headphones linked together, allowing the consumer to form an incredible bond with the heapdhones they own.

## Below is an image of my final project on figma.
